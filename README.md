# DoS-Mitigation
Denial of Service Mitigation with Client-Server Puzzles
The goal is to create a four-step protocol between two processes, one will act as the client while the other will be the server. Given the request, the server generates a k-bit hard puzzle. Trying different puzzle difficulties to see the impact. For example, in one instance, k = 8, and observe how many connection requests the client is able to make. Then increase, set k = 16, 20, 32, and observing the difference.
